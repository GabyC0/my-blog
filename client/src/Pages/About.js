      <p>
        Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm so excited that you're here! I started putting this blog together in the hopes of motivating myself to add information about my adventures. This includes pictures and perhaps stories...maybe even some recommendations. While I am no expert traveller, I have collected quite a bit of experience through my travel time. Currently I have visited about 15 countries and hope to continue to add to that throughout my life. I hope this blog is useful to you regardless of your travel experience. I believe in the sharing of knowledge to help others and hope you pass along your knowledge as well. Feel free to share any thoughts and/or ideas!
        <br />
        <br />
        Best always,
        <br />
        Gaby
